# CCShakeAction

## What is this?
A shaking action for Cocos2d-x. It shakes the cocos2d node.

## Note
- Uses Perlin Noise<br>
- Tested on Cocos2d-x 3.10 version.
- Can be used like other built-in actions. Read comment in code for details.
- I did not write the core algorithm for shaking, but made it to work on Cocos2d-x 3.10 version because none of them out on the internet worked as described.
